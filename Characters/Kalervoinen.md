### **Kullerwoinen Overview

Kullerwoinen is a relatively minor but significant character, known primarily as the father of **Kullervo**, one of the epic’s most tragic figures. Kullerwoinen is involved in a feud with his brother, **Untamo**, which sets the stage for Kullervo’s troubled life. Also refered to as Kullervo. 

### **Kalervo’s Story in the _Kalevala_**

- Kullerwoinen and Untamoinen are brothers who become enemies. Untamo wages war against Kalervo, killing most of his family and taking his wife as a captive.
- Kalervo’s wife gives birth to **Kullervo** while in captivity. Untamo tries to kill the child multiple times, fearing he will seek revenge, but Kullervo miraculously survives.
- Kullervo eventually grows up filled with anger and bitterness, seeking vengeance for his family's suffering.

Kallerwoinen himself does not play a major active role beyond this backstory—his main importance lies in being the father of Kullervo, whose tragic fate mirrors themes of revenge, fate, and destruction.
