Kullervo is a tragic character from Finnish mythology, specifically from the _Kalevala_, Finland’s national epic compiled by Elias Lönnrot. His story is one of the darkest and most tragic in the epic, filled with themes of revenge, fate, and despair.

The son of [[Kalervoinen]] and [[Untamala]], Kullervo is seperated from his parents at birth and lives a life with his Uncle, [[Untamoinen]]. 

Although his physical apperence is not often described, he is described as having sky-blue stockings and golden rings for hair. Many artist interpretations (derived from his tragic story of slavery) depict him in unkept, dark clothes with a sunken in face. 

We see glimpses of Kullervo's personality through what and does and says. Kullervo could be described as vengeful, defiant, fatalistic, and lonely. Kullervo is consumed by anger from an early age due to the cruelty he endures. He never forgives those who wrong him and seeks revenge whenever possible. His act of killing [[Ilmarinen]]’s wife by tricking her into eating a stone-filled loaf is a prime example of his ruthless vengeance. 

Kullervo lacks self-restraint and often acts impulsively, which leads to disastrous consequences. His inability to control his rage makes him dangerous, not just to his enemies but also to himself. He never truly finds belonging, even after reuniting with his family. His suffering makes him an outsider. His inability to connect with others contributes to his tragic downfall.

In many ways, Kullervo is a proto-antihero; someone who fights against his fate but only brings more destruction in the process. His personality makes him a compelling but deeply tragic figure.
### **Kullervo’s Cycle in the _Kalevala_**

- **Orphaned and Enslaved**: Kullervo is born into misfortune. His family is either killed or separated due to the treachery of his uncle, Untamo, who tries multiple times to kill him as a child but fails. Instead, Untamo sells Kullervo into slavery.
- **Betrayal and Vengeance**: As a slave, Kullervo is mistreated and forced to work. He is eventually sold to Ilmarinen, a legendary smith, whose wife abuses him. In retaliation, Kullervo causes her death by tricking her into eating bread filled with a magical stone.
- **Accidental Incest**: After escaping slavery, Kullervo reunites with his parents. However, when he unknowingly seduces and sleeps with his long-lost sister, she kills herself upon discovering the truth.
- **Suicide**: Consumed by grief and rage, Kullervo exacts revenge on his enemies but finds no peace. Ultimately, he takes his own life by falling on his sword.

### **Themes and Influence**

Kullervo's story is a powerful tale of fate, suffering, and the inability to escape one’s tragic destiny. His character has been compared to figures from other mythologies, such as Oedipus or Hamlet.

J.R.R. Tolkien was heavily influenced by Kullervo’s story when creating the character of Túrin Turambar in _The Silmarillion_, whose fate mirrors Kullervo’s in many ways.
