### **Tuonela – The Land of the Dead**

- **A Dark, Mysterious Place**: Tuonela is a shadowy, gloomy realm separated from the land of the living by the **dark river[[Tuoni]]**. Souls must cross this river to reach the underworld, often guided by a black swan.
- **No Return**: Traditionally, once a soul enters Tuonela, there is no return—though, in mythology, heroes like **[[Wainamoinen]]** undertake perilous journeys to and from Tuonela.
