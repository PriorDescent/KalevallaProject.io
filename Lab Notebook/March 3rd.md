When writing Vainamoinen's character page, I am mostly drawing from events that have taken place within epic poem. There could be human error/bias based on my reading of the text.
	- Could use a text-scrapping tool (AI) to gather larger ideas on the character
		- risk to accuracy
	- Include other scholars readings of the characters
		- issue is that there is limited scholarly work on the Kalevala. 
- Could include images (art interpretations) of certain characters and scenes to a visual element to the poem, furthering its accessibility and comprehensibility.
