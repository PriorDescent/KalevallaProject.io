 **Pohja** (or **Pohjola**) is a mythical northern land, often depicted as a dark, cold, and hostile place. It is ruled by **Louhi**, a powerful and cunning witch-queen who frequently opposes the heroes of Kaleva, such as [[Wäinämöinen]], Ilmarinen, and Lemminkäinen.

### **Features of Pohja in the _Kalevala_**

- Pohjola is often portrayed as a land of sorcery and wealth, where magical events take place.
- Louhi promises her daughter’s hand in marriage to Ilmarinen if he can forge the legendary **Sampo**, a magical mill that brings prosperity.
- Many of the _Kalevala_'s conflicts arise from interactions between Pohjola and Kaleva, including battles over the Sampo.
- Pohja represents an "otherworldly" place, symbolizing chaos, mystery, and foreign power in contrast to the heroic homeland of Kalevala/Karelia.
