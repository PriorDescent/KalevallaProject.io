I think it is important to **keep as much of the original text as possible** because the narrative itself is out of an oral tradition, has been curated, and translated; therefore, minimal manipulation is the approach I would like to take. 
	- Instead, focus on giving para-text and supporting text, summaries, and theme traces through annotations and separate linked documents/pages. 
Completed Rune I.
