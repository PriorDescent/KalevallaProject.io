My idea for Digital Experiment project: I would like to use digital tools and a digital humanist approach (focus on minimal computing) to digitizing a version of the Kalevala. The Kalevala is the oral creation poem of Finland. Originally compiled by Elias Lonnrot, the text is entirley in Finnish. Although translated to English (by J.R.R. Tolkien, in fact) and being available on Project Gutenberg, the text remains very inaccessible in its material, mistranslations, and topics. For example, characters have multiple names depending on the "rhyme" scheme. Furthermore, the nuaces of the Finnish Language makes the text feel convoluted and dense.  Being of Finnish descent, I have a personal connection to the text. The goal of this experiment is to transcribe and annotate at least some of the Kalevala text as a demonstrations of what is possible with digital humanist tools when working with archaic texts.
