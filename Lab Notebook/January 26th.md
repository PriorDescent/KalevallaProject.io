- Downloaded Obsidian
- Uploaded Kalevala document as well as some supporting resources
- Began to annotate by creating a character page for Vainamoinen. 
	- One issue I have run into is the text version spells Vainamonen as Wainamonen. Although not incorrect given the Finnish dialect, the majority of texts including the paper copy of The Kalevala I own spell it with a "V"
	- Should I change the W to V?
	- Research possible program for easy replacement
