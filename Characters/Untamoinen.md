**Untamoinen** (also called **Untamo**) is the brother and rival of **Kalervo**. He is best known for his role in the tragic story of **Kullervo**, Kalervo's son.

### **Untamoinen’s Role in the _Kalevala_**

- **Feud with Kalervo**: Untamo and Kalervo are brothers who fall into a bitter conflict. Untamo eventually attacks Kalervo’s people, killing most of them and taking Kalervo’s wife captive.
- **Attempts to Kill Kullervo**: When Kalervo’s wife gives birth to Kullervo in captivity, Untamo fears that the child will grow up to seek revenge. He tries multiple times to kill Kullervo—drowning, burning, and hanging him—but Kullervo miraculously survives each attempt.
- **Selling Kullervo into Slavery**: Seeing that he cannot kill the boy, Untamo instead sells him as a slave to Ilmarinen, where Kullervo’s tragic fate unfolds.

Untamoinen represents cowardice, cruelty, and treachery. He lacks the heroic or magical qualities of other _Kalevala_ figures and is mostly known for his role in Kullervo’s backstory.
