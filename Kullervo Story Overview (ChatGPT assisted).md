The story of **Kullervo** in the _Kalevala_ is one of the most tragic and intense tales in Finnish mythology. It centers on themes of fate, revenge, and despair, making Kullervo one of the darkest characters in the epic. His story is told through 6 chapters (Runes 31-36). This project attempts to make Kullervo's story more accessible. It is story of epic tragedy and mystical serfdom that highlights the most vile aspects of humanity. 

The Kalevala is an epic poem that is mostly a creation tale about the *Land of Heroes* or "Finland". Part of nationalist poetry, the Kalevala serves as a Atlantean story of Finnish oral mythology. 

### **Kullervo’s Origins: A Cursed Birth**

Kullervo is born into the Untamo clan, but his father, Kalervo, and most of his family are killed in a feud with his uncle Untamoinen. Untamo, fearing Kullervo’s potential for revenge, repeatedly tries to kill him—throwing him into a river, burning him, and even hanging him—but Kullervo miraculously survives each attempt. Realizing he cannot kill the boy, Untamo instead sells him into slavery.

### **Kullervo’s Life as a Slave**

Kullervo is placed under the care of Ilmarinen’s wife, who mistreats him. She bakes a loaf of bread with a stone inside, breaking his knife—the only keepsake from his lost family. Enraged, Kullervo summons his latent magical powers and sics a pack of wolves and bears on his mistress, leading to her gruesome death.

Fearing further trouble, Ilmarinen sends Kullervo away, and he eventually reunites with his long-lost family, some distant family members are still alive.

### **The Incestuous Tragedy**

Wandering in the wilderness, Kullervo unknowingly seduces a young woman. After sleeping together, they realize they are siblings and she is the daughter of Kalervoinen and Untamala (his sister). Devastated, his sister drowns herself in shame. Kullervo, overcome with guilt and grief, returns home, only to find that his entire family has perished.

### **Kullervo’s Revenge and Suicide**

With nothing left to lose, Kullervo exacts revenge on Untamo, slaughtering his entire clan. However, revenge does not bring him peace. Filled with remorse and hopelessness, he returns to the forest and asks his sword whether it is willing to drink his blood. The sword coldly replies that it has already tasted the blood of the guilty, so why not that of the innocent?

With that, Kullervo takes his own life, dying in despair.
